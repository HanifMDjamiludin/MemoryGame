Memory Game

Welcome to our memory game! This game is designed to test and improve your memory skills.

How to Play

The game consists of a grid of 8 cells numbered 0-7. Each cell contains a hidden number. The objective of the game is to match pairs of numbers by flipping over one cell at a time.

To start the game, compile the MemoryGame.cpp and MemoryGameClient.cpp file and run the executable file. The cell's contents will shuffle and hide the numbers. Enter the number associated with the cell you want to flip first. Then, enter the second number associated with the next cell you think will match the first in order to reveal its contents. If the two numbers match, the cells will stay open you can search for the next pair. If the numbers do not match, the second cell will flip back over and you'll have to try again.

The game ends when all pairs have been matched.

Try to finish the game in as few moves as possible and see if you can beat your high score!
